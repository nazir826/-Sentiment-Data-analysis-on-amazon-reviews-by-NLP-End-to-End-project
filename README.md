Sentiment analysis is a kind of data mining where you measure the inclination of peopleâ€™s opinions by using NLP (natural language processing), text analysis, and computational linguistics. We perform sentiment analysis mostly on public reviews, social media platforms, and similar sites.

Sentiment analysis projects often involve analyzing text data from diverse sources. For example, a sentiment analysis Python project can help students learn the nuances of that language, context, and cultural variations present in real-world data.
